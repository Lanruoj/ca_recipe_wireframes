Challenge: Recipe Website Wireframes
For this challenge, you should use a wireframing tool to create a recipe website. The website must contain these sections:

Website header with a title and logo

Navbar / website menu

Recipe index page containing multiple "cards" or links to recipes, where each recipe has a photo and title

Recipe page containing: 

Recipe photo

Recipe title

Recipe blurb

Recipe content

Website footer

You should create at least two pages to fulfill this challenge.

Think about how you can represent those sections on a webpage, and how existing websites currently represent them. Learning from existing websites will help a lot with this challenge!
